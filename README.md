# Understanding Customers Shopping Behaviour
## Project Overview
This project aims to utilize Power BI to extract insights into customer shopping behavior, with the primary objective of answering important questions raised by our stakeholders.

## Methodology
- Data import and cleaning
- Data analysis and visualization
- Insights and recommendation

## Data Cleaning
The CSV file was successfully imported into Power BI and thoroughly checked for consistency. Fortunately, the data was found to be clean and free from inconsistencies, allowing us to proceed with data analysis and visualization.

## Power Bi Dashboard
A Power BI dashboard was created to showcase essential findings and visualizations derived from the data analysis. This interactive dashboard includes charts and tables providing an intuitive and comprehensive view of the data.

## Insights
- The majority of our customer base is centered in Montana and California, with lower concentrations in Kansas and Rhode Island.
- Purchases were highest in the fall season at $60,000, with the clothing category leading overall sales at $104,000 across all seasons.
- Customers aged 53 had the highest average purchase amount at $68, while those aged 48 had the lowest at $53.
- Males outspent their female counterparts, with expenditures totaling $158,000 compared to $75,000.


## Recommendations
- Explore strategies to further expand the customer base in states like Arizona, Hawaii, Kanas, and Rhodes Island.
- Consider optimizing inventory and marketing efforts to capitalize on the high purchasing trends observed during the fall season.
- Implement targeted marketing campaigns and promotions during the summer season to boost sales, addressing the lower purchasing trends observed during that period.
- Tailor marketing approaches or incentives to enhance the engagement and spending behavior of customers aged 48.
- Offering free shipping as a regular incentive and structuring promotions for both weekly and annual purchases can enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.
